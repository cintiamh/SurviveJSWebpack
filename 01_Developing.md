## Getting Started

### What is Webpack?

Entries themselves are **modules** and can point to other modules through **imports**.

When you bundle a project through webpack, it traverses through imports, constructing a **dependency graph** of the project and then generating the **output** based on the configuration.

It's possible to define **split points** generating separate bundles within the project code itself.
